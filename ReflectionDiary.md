***Reflection for the week of 4/23/2020 to 4/30/2020***

I made the decision this week with the goal to start and finish the card functionality for the game. I am pretty excited with
the current progress because I think that I will have it done by Sunday Night. Despite the fact that I have a midterm due at 
midnight tonight (I am mostly finished), I decided to get as close as possible to a daily work ethic on the project. That, with the
combination of really formulating a plan has helped with my progress so much. It has allowed to take a step back and deal with one
of the biggest hurdles that I have had recently with programming. I have been over-designing everything that I have been working 
on. Initially, I will get an image of what I want in my head and a general idea of how I am going to get there. Then, I would just
jump into it. This would not necessarily be a bad thing or a good thing, but for me personally it is my greatest pitfall. Once I
start working I do not just achieve tech debt but I conflate issues with the code by either ignoring them or not stepping back 
properly to address the issue. So, changing my habits has been the biggest eye-opening experience for me. I will work until I get
stuck on a problem. Then, I will step back away from it for a time from anywhere to an hour to a day or two. After doing that I 
head back to my work and look through it, noticing the fundamental mistakes I made with my logic. I can then adjust with a fresh 
perspective. In a way, this has trained me to be a better programmer while I work in a single sitting. I can sort of feel the 
motions that I get myself stuck in. I have a feeling now when the problem is due to my design or because of bad coding. It now 
allows me to shift gears and help address the problem without necessarily needing a break. This cycle is a vast improvement of 
what I have done in the past. I intend to continue it.

***Reflection for the period of 5/01/2020 to 5/11/2020***

After looking over my initial plan that I turned in for the project, I am quite pleased to say that I have satisfied all of the milestones that I set for myself. The dungeon scene and the card scene have a solid foundation that I can build upon. Since the actual content of this game is so small, I only ever had to use Arrays and Lists to store data that I wanted to manipulate in-game. I think that eventually the game will require data structures like a Dictionary for a card database, a BinaryTree for AI Boss logic, and a Queue for particle effects or projectiles.

This experience was humbling for me. I thought that the cards would be the easiest part since they were 2-D and I had worked with them before on the BlackJack project. However, the implementation of cards in this game ended up being the biggest pain. I spent the largest portion of my time working on figuring out how to get the data from the code within Unity to interact with the card. Once I was finished with that a week and a half had gone by and I did not have much to show. I was stressed about how I was going to manage the dungeon scene. Much to my surpise, a lot of the concepts that I learned from the Ball-Roller game were applied in developing the dungeon scene. I received a lot of help from online resources as well. The Unity reference guide taught me about NavMeshAgent and how it is perfect for building "chaser" models and YouTube has a lot of tutorials that were relevant to what I was interested in (especially Brackeys, credit to them for their insight on Unity Development).

The biggest gripe that I have is the way that MonoBehavior functions. Normally, I am used to being able to make function calls easily (C++ makes me feel spoiled). However, my lack of experience with C# mixed with the MonoBehavior hierarchy put what feels like a double-layered boundary on my ability to make function calls. I was glad to learn about ScriptableObjects and how they can interact with Prefabs to store data outside of objects connected by MonoBehavior. Again, this is a point that humbled me. I know that I do not know enough about ScriptableObjects to use them effectively. So, once finals are finished I have a bunch of YouTube videos saved on Watch Later so that I can learn more about them and hopefully apply that knowledge to building bigger systems within the game.
