***Reflection for the week of 4/23/2020 to 4/30/2020***
I made the decision this week with the goal to start and finish the card functionality for the game. I am pretty excited with
the current progress because I think that I will have it done by Sunday Night. Despite the fact that I have a midterm due at 
midnight tonight (I am mostly finished), I decided to get as close as possible to a daily work ethic on the project. That, with the
combination of really formulating a plan has helped with my progress so much. It has allowed to take a step back and deal with one
of the biggest hurdles that I have had recently with programming. I have been over-designing everything that I have been working 
on. Initially, I will get an image of what I want in my head and a general idea of how I am going to get there. Then, I would just
jump into it. This would not necessarily be a bad thing or a good thing, but for me personally it is my greatest pitfall. Once I
start working I do not just achieve tech debt but I conflate issues with the code by either ignoring them or not stepping back 
properly to address the issue. So, changing my habits has been the biggest eye-opening experience for me. I will work until I get
stuck on a problem. Then, I will step back away from it for a time from anywhere to an hour to a day or two. After doing that I 
head back to my work and look through it, noticing the fundamental mistakes I made with my logic. I can then adjust with a fresh 
perspective. In a way, this has trained me to be a better programmer while I work in a single sitting. I can sort of feel the 
motions that I get myself stuck in. I have a feeling now when the problem is due to my design or because of bad coding. It now 
allows me to shift gears and help address the problem without necessarily needing a break. This cycle is a vast improvement of 
what I have done in the past. I intend to continue it.
